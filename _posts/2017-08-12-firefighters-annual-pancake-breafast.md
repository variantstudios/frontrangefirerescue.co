<div>Every year on the second Saturday of August, to celebrate the Milliken Beef &lsquo;n Bean Day the firefighters of the Front Range Fire Rescue Authority host a pancake breakfast for the community.</div>

<div>August 12, 2017 firefighters will start pancake preparations around 4 a.m., preparing the batter in a gargantuan cauldron looking pot with a power drill mixer in the back of the firehouse kitchen. They will prepare the meat, eggs, and coffee. Breakfast is served at 5:00 am!</div>

<div>The cost for this all you can eat event is $6.00 Adults, $5.00 Seniors, and kids under 12 are $4.00. Firefighters expect to make around 1,500 pancakes, 800 eggs, and countless cups of coffee throughout the morning.</div>

<div><em>&ldquo;For Front Range Fire Rescue, Beef and Bean Day, like BBQ Days in Johnstown, is about honoring a longstanding tradition in these two towns.&nbsp; Nearly all of the money received from the sale of pancakes or T-shirts goes directly into a fund to buy syrup and sausage for next year.&nbsp; It's no longer about raising money for important equipment, but rather showing appreciation to the current citizens and respect to the former firefighters. In addition, this is an opportunity for our firefighters to interact with the community in a non-emergency situation and thank them for their continued support&rdquo;,</em> Chief Ron Bateman</div>

<div>The breakfast will be held in the station garage, the fire trucks will be out in the driveway for display. Expect the line to be down Irene Avenue by 8:30 a.m. There will also be fire department T-Shirts for sale.</div>

<div>FRFRA Board Co-President Blair Howe, said his &ldquo;favorite part of the pancake breakfast every year is the opportunity to interact with our community. &nbsp;To open up the fire station and talk to our professional and awesome staff&rdquo;.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Breakfast will wind down at 9:00 am, to allow everyone to get a spot on Broad St. to watch the parade. The Milliken Parade begins at 10:00 am. There are many events throughout the day ending with a Fireworks Display at Lola Park at 9:00pm. For a list of events please go to www,gilliamzoo.wixsite.com/beefnbeanday</div>
