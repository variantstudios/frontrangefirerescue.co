Every day, children are born with muscular dystrophy, and adults are diagnosed with ALS and other life-threatening diseases that take away their most basic freedoms - like walking, talking, eating, hugging, and ultimately life itself.

For more than sixty years, fire fighters have been Filling the Boot on street corners - raising money to help MDA fight back. With COVID guidelines we are conducting the drive online.

Now I'm asking you to help us Fill the Boot.

The money we raise will help children and adults in our community, and will also help support innovative research to change the future for people with neuromuscular disease.

Please make a donation. Thank you\!
