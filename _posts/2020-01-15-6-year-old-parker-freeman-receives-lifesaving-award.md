The bravery of Front Range Fire Rescue (FRFR) first responders and young hero, Parker Freeman was on full display Tuesday as Fire Chief Michael West awarded Parker with the Life Saving Award in front of the Front Range Fire Rescue Board of Directors

The quick thinking of a child saved the lives of everyone in a house fire. Six-year-old Parker Freeman was the only one awake in his family’s home, when a fire started in the garage. Parker discovered the fire, then calmly woke up his family and helped them get safely outside. Parker has participated in fire drills at school and has watched video games about exit plans. He knew enough to tell his family they had to get out quickly and to shut all of the doors behind them.

FRFR Inspector Kurt Nakata spoke with Parker’s parents after the fire. That’s when he was told about Parker’s actions. When Inspector Nakata put together the pieces of the event, he realized that Parker was single-handedly responsible for saving the lives of everyone in the home.

Front Range Fire Rescue crews from Station 2 arrived within four minutes of dispatch, to the fire in Milliken at 02:08 a.m., on Monday, December 16th. Upon arrival, firefighters found a garage fully engulfed in flames. With the help of Platteville Gilcrest Fire Protection, the crews quickly had the fire under control.

Red Cross is assisting the family. The fire’s smoke damaged the house and displaced the family.
