In an unprecedented ceremony on Wednesday, January 10th at the Board meeting, five of Front Range Fire Rescue’s firefighters were promoted to Engineers. All achieved their new rank after a rigorous testing and interview process. The Engineers are posted here with Chiefs Bernie Covillo and Ty Drage.
