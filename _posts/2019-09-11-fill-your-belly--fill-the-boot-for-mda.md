# "Fill the Boot" for MDA\!&nbsp;

Thanks to your generosity, kids and adults with muscular dystrophy, ALS, and related life-threatening diseases can continue to benefit from MDAs life-changing research. Front Range Fire Rescue will also be hosting a spaghetti dinner on October 6th. The folks at Johnson's Corner have offered to do the cooking and s, and Shamrock Foods will help with food. All proceeds will go to the MDA "Fill the Boot" fund. More information soon.
