CONGRATULATIONS FIREFIGHTER BISHOP DICKERSON&nbsp;

Front Range Fire Rescue (FRFR) swore in its newest full-time member Wednesday night, at the FRFR Board meeting. Bishop Dickerson will join the department after serving the last 15 months as a reserve firefighter. Chief Michael West conducted the oath and other department staff welcomed Dickerson by assisting in the ceremony.

West said, “Bishop has demonstrated our values of compassion, courage, and professionalism. I appreciate his drive, and I am confident that he will be an excellent addition to our department.”

FF Dickerson is currently attending CSU Global and pursuing his Bachelor's Degree in Organizational Leadership. Dickerson plans to graduate in the Summer of 2020. When Dickerson isn’t working as a Firefighter or going to school, he enjoys traveling, recently returning from a vacation in Paris, with his fianc&eacute;. Dickerson remarked, “I'm excited to be a part of FRFR as a career member and look forward to many years of service for the communities of Johnstown and Milliken.”
