Chief Bateman has a Master’s Degree in Organizational Leadership from Gonzaga University and plans to continue researching and teaching leadership following his retirement.

Michael West has been a member of the fire service for over three decades and is a fourth-generation firefighter. He currently serves as District Chief at South Metro Fire Rescue in Centennial and will be retiring after 29 years with that department. He holds a Master’s Degree from Seton Hall University in Strategic Communication and Leadership and also holds degrees in Management as well as Fire Science.&nbsp; In his spare time, Chief West is a bagpiper with the Colorado Emerald Society and enjoys travel and motorcycle riding. He is looking forward to becoming an active member of the Front Range Fire community and serving as the next Fire Chief.

The selection came after an in-depth review and assessment of 35 candidates. &nbsp;Front Range Fire Rescue Board President, Darrin Rutt said that Chief West’s “years of experience, ability to mentor and lead, along with his exemplary education, make him the best person to replace Fire Chief Ron Bateman." &nbsp;Rutt went on to say, “Under the leadership of Chief West, I know that the safety of the public and the safety of our firefighters is in capable hands.
