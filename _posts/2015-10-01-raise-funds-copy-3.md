Front Range Fire Rescue Authority would like to announce the hiring of two new full-time firefighters, Daniel Skoglund and Bryan Leto, both to begin January 1, 2016. The recent mill levy  which was passed by voters allowed an increase in staffing which will immediately improve our career staffing levels for our growing community.

Fire Chief Ron Bateman said the two new firefighters will be working at Station 1 in Johnstown. The hiring will bring the full-time firefighters up to 21 with a class of 10 new reservists also beginning on January 1, 2016 the total Reservist Firefighters will be 36.

Daniel Skoglund grew up in Texas and moved to Colorado to attend CSU. While at CSU he competed in Lacrosse. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Forestry Fire Science in 2013. He has been working as an Emergency Room tech at Northern Colorado Medical Center in Greeley.  Firefighter Skoglund has also been with Front Range Fire Rescue Authority as a Reservist the past two years.

Bryan Leto graduated from Mullen High School in Denver in 2011 and, initially, enrolled in college to study business.  He became interested in the fire service and switched over to fire science as a course of study, graduating with an associate’s degree last year from Red Rocks Community College.  He has been with Front Range Fire Rescue for just under two years.
