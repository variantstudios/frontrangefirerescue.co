FRFRA crews raised $7,406.59 for MDA over the Labor Day Weekend. Thanks to ALL who donated. Our hearts are heavy today, and with our brothers and sisters in Lansing, MI as they mourn the loss of seven-year veteran firefighter Dennis Rodeman, who was struck and killed while collecting money for MDA.
