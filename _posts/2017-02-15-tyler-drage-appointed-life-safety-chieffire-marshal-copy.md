Front Range Fire Rescue Authority is pleased to announce the appointment of Tyler Drage as FRFRA’s new Life Safety Chief/Fire Marshal effective Monday, March 6, 2017.&nbsp; The Life Safety Chief/Fire Marshal combines the traditional duties of Fire Marshal with additional responsibilities in community and life safety education, community engagement and emergency preparedness. In addition, he will work with personnel in Johnstown/ Milliken and Larimer/Weld Counties, other fire and emergency management agencies in Northern Colorado and internal FRFRA personal to implement a full range of community and life safety activities.

Fire Chief Ron Bateman appointed Drage following a national search that began in September. “Tyler Drage competed against a national pool of candidates for the position of Life Safety Chief/Fire Marshal. He proved that with his experience as a fire professional as well as his keen understanding of the Fire Department that he is the best person for this job,” said Bateman. “I look forward to welcoming him to the Authority’s Team.”

Drage began his career in public safety in the summer of 1991. He was then certified as an Emergency Medical Technician, started as a dive rescue specialist for Loveland Fire Rescue while working for Colorado State Parks. In 2006, he joined Loveland Fire Rescue full-time as a fire inspector/investigator.&nbsp; His most recent position with Loveland was in the Community Safety Division, where he managed the accreditation process, coordinated fire investigations, and managed the hazardous materials permit program. In addition, he assisted WSFR with their accreditation.&nbsp; Drage is a native of Northern Colorado and currently lives in Larimer County with his wife Jamie. Their two children both attend college, one at UNC and the other at University of Nebraska.

“My family and I are very excited for me to join Front Range Fire Rescue Authority as the new Life Safety Chief/Fire Marshal.” Drage said. “I’m looking forward to joining the FRFR family and bringing my skills to help build the agency for the future.”

Chief Drage will be recognized at the Front Range Fire Rescue Authority Board meeting on March 8, 2017.
