<br>In today’s world, citizens are participating in the discussion about their quality of life, taxes, and government services. Realizing that public input is the key to tailoring the services that Front Range Fire Rescue provides, the District has established a Citizens Advisory Group (CAG). FRFR is interested in receiving input and advice from a formalized group of citizens who have a desire to express their interest in improving the emergency services within the community. The CAG will serve as a vital link between the District's leadership and the public we serve.

Do you want to have a voice in Front Range Fire Rescue’s growth and future? Have you wondered, “Can the Fire Department benefit from my experience and knowledge?” If you think the answer might be yes, then take that initial step forward and put your perspective, leadership, and knowledge to work by serving on the Front Range Fire Rescue citizens advisory group. The application is here.

If you have questions about the expectations, time commitment, or simply want more information, please contact Life Safety Chief Ty Drage at tdrage@frfr.co or 970-587-4464.
