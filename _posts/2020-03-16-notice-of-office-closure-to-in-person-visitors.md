The recent COVID-19 outbreak has impacted every community in Colorado. Based on the advice of local and state health officials, we have decided to close FRFRâ€™s administrative offices to in-person visitors, effective March 16 through March 31 to protect the health, safety, and well-being of our community members and staff.Our dedication to providing timely and professional emergency services to our community remains our highest priority. As circumstances have changed over the past weeks and months, our team has been busy monitoring the situation to remain fully informed of circumstances locally, regionally and state-wide. We will continue to regularly monitor this evolving situation and will determine when our administrative offices can again receive visitors.

* Fire stations will remain open and ready to serve our community and responding to all calls for service.
* Our team is still here to help, and we will still be completing all normal business operations.
* Our staff will be available during normal business hours via phone (970-587-4464) or email (info@frfr.co)

We will continue to monitor the situation and follow the advice of the Federal and State health officials on best practices to care for our patients and our responders. We ask that you also follow the recommendations of those officials to minimize spread and to keep yourself healthy. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
