\*\*Front Range Fire Rescue is excited to announce the creation of a career firefighter hiring eligibility list. We anticipate using this list to hire at least one full-time firefighter in August of 2020. Front Range Fire Rescue protects approximately 22,000 people in the towns of Johnstown and Milliken, as well as portions of Weld and Larimer County in Colorado. The area is growing quickly, and we anticipate adding a fourth fire station in the coming years. \*\*
