Today you might notice something new at FRFR. Our crews are wearing red t-shirts instead of our standard blue ones. Why red? Red is worn by many public service agencies to “Remember Everyone Deployed.” We are wearing these in honor of those military service members keeping us safe in the US and abroad. We are also honoring those firefighters among our ranks who are veterans. This is especially timely this week, as one of our firefighters, Ryan Boor, just returned to the firehouse this week from a year-long military deployment.

Look for our crews wearing RED every Friday\!\!\!\!
