I hope this post finds you well. As you likely know, the Governor has issued a statewide facemask order. We want to remind you that we require physical distancing and masks for anyone visiting our facilities at Front Range Fire Rescue (FRFR). We believe that the mask order, and compliance in our buildings, helps keep you and our responders safe.

FRFR has been lucky, thus far, in that only one of our members has ever tested positive. Additionally, despite the number of patients with COVID-19 we have cared for in the last few months, we have avoided having any other staff member exposed. That said, we remain diligent and cautious in our approach as we know that this pandemic is still here and can significantly affect our ability to serve you.

Thanks, and stay safe\!

Michael West Fire Chief
