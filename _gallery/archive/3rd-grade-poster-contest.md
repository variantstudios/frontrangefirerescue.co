Thank you to all of the 3rd grade Teachers and Students that participated in our first fire safety poster contest. Congratulations to Knowledge Quest Academy who won the traveling trophy for the highest percentage of participation! They will keep the trophy in their classroom for the remaining school year.

The 2015 Fire Prevention Theme is **Hear the BEEP where you SLEEP!**        Hear the Beep Where You Sleep: Every Bedroom Needs a Working Smoke Alarm helps fire departments remind people about the importance of having working smoke alarms in their homes, including bedrooms, and testing them monthly. One of the most important fire safety measures you can take in your home is to ensure that you have working smoke alarms.  At a minimum, working smoke alarms should be located in or near each bedroom and sleeping area, and on each level of your home.  Test your smoke alarms monthly, and replace batteries at least once a year. Did you know that smoke alarm sensors get weaker over time, even if they are hard-wired and/or have fresh batteries?  The smoke sensors themselves have a limited lifespan.  Smoke alarm units should be replaced once they are ten years old.
