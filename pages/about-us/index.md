Front Range Fire Rescue (FRFR) is a fire protection district, organized as a special district under Title 32 of Colorado Revised Statutes, serving a 74-square mile service area that includes the towns of Johnstown and Milliken, as well as unincorporated portions of Weld and Larimer counties. FRFR was formally established on January 1, 2018, as a result of the merger of the Johnstown and Milliken fire protection districts during the November 2017 general election. The Milliken and Johnstown fire protection districts have been in existence since 1949 and 1952 respectively. Prior to the 2018 merger, the agency existed since early 2015 as a fire authority – an independent government entity formed through an inter-governmental agreement between the Milliken and Johnstown fire protection districts.<br>FRFR is an all-hazards emergency services agency, providing fire suppression; emergency medical services; basic and technical rescue; hazardous materials mitigation; fire prevention, inspection, and investigation; public education; and domestic preparedness, planning and response for approximately 22,000 residents. The District’s core values of courage, compassion, and professionalism are applied by all members of the District to provide the highest level of service possible to all citizens and guests of the communities served.
