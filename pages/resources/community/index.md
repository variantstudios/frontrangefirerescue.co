**Ride-Along:** Interested in what the fire service is all about? Please schedule a ride-along with us to get an in depth view of everything we do. On your ride-along, you will be able to respond to incidents, train, eat meals, and learn about the firefighters serving your community. Please email us at info@frfr.co or call (970) 587-4464 to schedule a ride along.

**Station Tours:** We invite you into your local fire house to tour the station and all equipment. This is a great opportunity for small groups to see a brief overview of what firefighting is all about. On your station tour, you will be able to visit all parts of the fire station and look over every fire truck that responds to incidents from that fire house.
