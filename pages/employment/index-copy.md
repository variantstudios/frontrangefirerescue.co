**Reserve Program**

Reserve members work alongside our career firefighters in our stations. Reserve members are an integral part of our services performing the same duties and maintaining the same certifications as our career firefighters. Reserve members are paid a monthly stipend based upon hours worked and certification/education. Reserves are also able to gain further certification, attend internal and external training, and develop the skills to help them become career firefighters.
