###### **Ride-Along:** Interested in what the fire service is all about? Please schedule a ride-along with us to get an in depth view of everything we do. On your ride-along, you will be able to respond to incidents, train, eat meals, and learn about the firefighters serving your community. Please email us at info@frfr.co or call (970) 587-4464 to schedule a ride along.

###### **Citizen Advisory Group:**&nbsp;In today’s world, citizens are participating in the discussion about their quality of life, taxes, and government services. Realizing that public input is the key to tailoring the services that Front Range Fire Rescue provides, the District has established a Citizens Advisory Group (CAG). FRFR is interested in receiving input and advice from a formalized group of citizens who have a desire to express their interest in improving the emergency services within the community. The CAG will serve as a vital link between the District's leadership and the public we serve.&nbsp;[ FRFR Citizen Advisory Group Application.](/uploads/Citizens Advisory Group Application.Fill.in.pdf)

###### **&nbsp;Station Tours:** We invite you into your local fire house to tour the station and all equipment. This is a great opportunity for small groups to see a brief overview of what firefighting is all about. On your station tour, you will be able to visit all parts of the fire station and look over every fire truck that responds to incidents from that fire house.
